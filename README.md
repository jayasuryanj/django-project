Django is a popular web framework that allows you to create web applications using Python. It is free, open source, and designed to help developers build secure, scalable, and maintainable websites. Some of the features of Django are:

- It follows the model-template-view (MTV) pattern, which separates the data, presentation, and logic layers of the web application.
- It has a built-in admin interface that makes it easy to manage the data and users of the website.
- It has a rich set of components that provide common functionality such as authentication, forms, sessions, caching, etc.
- It supports multiple databases and can perform complex queries using its object-relational mapper (ORM).
- It has a powerful template language that allows you to customize the look and feel of the website.
- It has a comprehensive documentation and a large community of developers who contribute to the project and provide support.
